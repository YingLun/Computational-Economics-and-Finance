\section*{Problem 1: Getting Started with Github}
When we set \texttt{racism=0.5}, we get an error message. The error occurs because in line 50 and 51 the command \texttt{nrow\_mover = length(mover)} and \texttt{nrow\_freehouse = length(freehouse)} respectively. However, when there is only one or two movers, the \texttt{length} commands returns three since there are three columns. Therefore, one should use \texttt{size(mover,1)} and \texttt{size(freehouse,1)} instead to get the number of rows.
